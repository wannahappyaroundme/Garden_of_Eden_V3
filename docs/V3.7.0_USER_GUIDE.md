# Garden of Eden V3.7.0 - User Guide

## Advanced AI Features

Version 3.7.0 introduces three powerful new features for advanced AI reasoning and knowledge management:

1. **GraphRAG** - Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval
2. **ReAct Agent** - Reasoning + Acting Framework
3. **Plan-and-Solve** - Multi-step Planning with User Approval

---

## 1. GraphRAG (Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval)

### Overview

GraphRAG enables the AI to build and query a knowledge graph from your conversations and documents. It automatically extracts entities (people, organizations, technologies, etc.) and their relationships, then uses this graph structure for more intelligent information retrieval.

### Key Features

- **9 Entity Types**: Person, Organization, Location, Technology, Concept, Tool, Project, Document, Event
- **8 Relationship Types**: WorksWith, PartOf, Uses, Creates, Knows, LocatedAt, DependsOn, RelatesTo
- **Community Detection**: Automatically groups related entities
- **Multi-hop Retrieval**: Finds information through relationship chains (up to 2 hops)
- **Graph Statistics**: Track entities, relationships, and communities

### How to Use

#### Building the Knowledge Graph

1. **From Conversations**: The system automatically extracts entities from your chat messages
2. **From Documents**: Upload text documents to extract structured knowledge

```typescript
// Frontend example
await invoke('graphrag_build_graph', {
  text: 'Your document text here...'
});
```

#### Searching the Knowledge Graph

1. Open the **Knowledge Graph** panel in the sidebar
2. Enter your search query
3. View results ranked by relevance
4. Click on entities to see detailed information and connections

**Example Queries**:
- "What technologies does John use?"
- "Show me all projects related to machine learning"
- "Find people working at Microsoft"

#### Viewing Graph Statistics

```typescript
const stats = await invoke('graphrag_stats');
// Returns: total_entities, total_relationships, total_communities
```

### Best Practices

- Feed the system rich, factual content for better entity extraction
- Use specific names for people, organizations, and projects
- Review extracted entities periodically for accuracy
- Clear old/irrelevant entities to keep the graph focused

## 2. ReAct Agent (Reasoning + Acting)

### Overview

The ReAct Agent uses a structured reasoning loop to solve complex problems. It alternates between thinking (reasoning) and acting (using tools), observing the results, and iterating until it finds an answer.

### ReAct Loop

```
1. Thought → Reason about what to do next
2. Action → Execute a tool (web search, file operations, etc.)
3. Observation → Observe the result
4. Repeat until Answer is found
```

### Available Tools

The ReAct Agent can use these production tools:

1. **WebSearch** - Search the web for information
2. **UrlFetch** - Fetch content from specific URLs
3. **FileRead** - Read files from your system
4. **FileWrite** - Write files to your system
5. **SystemInfo** - Get system information
6. **Calculator** - Perform mathematical calculations

### How to Use

#### Basic Usage

1. Open the **ReAct Agent** panel
2. Enter your task/query
3. Click **Execute**
4. Watch the reasoning steps unfold in real-time
5. View the final answer

**Example Tasks**:
- "Search for the latest news on quantum computing and summarize the key developments"
- "Calculate the compound interest for a $10,000 investment at 5% APR over 10 years"
- "Find and read the README file in my project directory"

#### Understanding the Output

Each execution shows:
- **Thought**: The agent's reasoning about what to do
- **Action**: The tool being used and parameters
- **Observation**: The result of the action
- **Answer**: The final conclusion

#### Configuration

```typescript
const config = await invoke('react_get_config');
// {
//   max_iterations: 5,
//   model: "qwen2.5:7b",
//   temperature: 0.1,
//   enable_verbose: true
// }
```

### Best Practices

- Start with specific, well-defined tasks
- Review the reasoning steps to understand the agent's logic
- If the agent gets stuck, try rephrasing your query
- Use for tasks that benefit from iterative problem-solving

## 3. Plan-and-Solve (Multi-step Planning)

### Overview

Plan-and-Solve generates detailed execution plans for complex goals that require multiple steps. It presents the plan for your approval before execution, giving you full control over what happens.

### Features

- **LLM-generated Plans**: AI creates structured plans with dependencies
- **User Approval Workflow**: Review and approve plans before execution
- **Dependency Tracking**: Steps execute only when prerequisites are met
- **Failure Handling**: Automatic recovery attempts for failed steps
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time status updates during execution
- **Execution History**: Review past plans and results

### How to Use

#### Creating a Plan

1. Open the **Plan-and-Solve** panel
2. Describe your goal in detail
3. Click **Generate Plan**

**Example Goals**:
- "Create a comprehensive market research report on electric vehicles, including competitor analysis and trend forecasting"
- "Organize my project files by category and create a documentation index"
- "Research and summarize the top 5 JavaScript frameworks for 2025"

#### Reviewing the Plan

The system will show:
- **Goal**: Your original objective
- **Steps**: Numbered, sequential actions
- **Estimated Time**: How long execution might take
- **Required Tools**: Which tools will be used
- **Risks**: Potential challenges or issues

Each step shows:
- **Description**: What will be done
- **Action**: Specific tool/operation
- **Expected Output**: What the step should produce
- **Dependencies**: Which steps must complete first

#### Approving and Executing

1. Review the plan carefully
2. Check for any risks or concerns
3. Click **Approve & Execute** or **Reject**
4. Monitor execution in real-time
5. View results and logs

#### Execution Results

After execution, you'll see:
- **Success/Failure Status**
- **Steps Completed/Failed/Skipped**
- **Execution Log**: Detailed timeline
- **Final Result**: Summary of outcomes

### Configuration

```typescript
const config = await invoke('planner_get_config');
// {
//   model: "qwen2.5:7b",
//   temperature: 0.3,
//   max_steps: 10,
//   enable_auto_recovery: true,
//   max_retry_attempts: 2
// }
```

### Best Practices

- Provide detailed, specific goals for better plans
- Review each step before approving
- Pay attention to the risks section
- Use for complex, multi-part tasks
- Keep goals achievable within 10 steps

## Statistics and Monitoring

### GraphRAG Stats

```typescript
const stats = await invoke('graphrag_stats');
// {
//   total_entities: 150,
//   total_relationships: 320,
//   total_communities: 12,
//   entity_types: { "Person": 45, "Organization": 30, ... },
//   relationship_types: { "WorksWith": 80, "Uses": 60, ... }
// }
```

### Plan-and-Solve Stats

```typescript
const stats = await invoke('planner_stats');
// {
//   total_plans: 25,
//   completed_plans: 20,
//   in_progress_plans: 2,
//   pending_approval: 3,
//   average_steps_per_plan: 6.4
// }
```

## Troubleshooting

### GraphRAG

**Issue**: No entities being extracted
- **Solution**: Ensure your text contains specific names and entities. Generic content won't extract well.

**Issue**: Search returns no results
- **Solution**: Build the graph first by processing documents or conversations.

### ReAct Agent

**Issue**: Agent reaches max iterations without answer
- **Solution**: Simplify your query or break it into smaller tasks.

**Issue**: Tool execution fails
- **Solution**: Check that required tools are available and properly configured.

### Plan-and-Solve

**Issue**: Generated plan seems off-target
- **Solution**: Provide more specific goal descriptions with clear expected outcomes.

**Issue**: Steps fail during execution
- **Solution**: Review the execution log to understand what went wrong. The system will attempt auto-recovery.
